Installation
============

Prerequisites: We use Python 3.6 for development and testing.
We recommend using Python 3.6 or higher, but lower versions might still work.

The TSIClient can be installed from PyPi:
.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install TSIClient


Or directly from GitHub:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/RaaLabs/TSIClient.git
